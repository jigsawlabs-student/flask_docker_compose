    "However when we move onto something like a web application, there are multiple services we can think of operating.  For example, just hosting the backend of the website could be a service, and the databasem could be another service, as could the task of gathering data, by say scraping other websites could be a service.   \n",

    "The `version` specifies the version number of docker-compose that is being used.  Then we specify each of the `services`.  For us, we have a `users` service, where we describe the `build`, `ports` and the `environment`.  The `build` key just specifies the file used to build the Dockerfile.  Here, relative to the location of the `docker-compose.yml` file, it's `./users/Dockerfile`.  The ports, are where we specify the mapping, 3000:5000, and `environment` is used for the environment variables.\n",

    "The hyphens that we see under `environment` is to indicate that what follows is a list, and we precede each element in the list with a `-`.  So we have a list of environment variables, so far of `FLASK_APP` and `FLASK_ENV`.  Using the `-` to indicate list elements is a yaml convention.\n",
